# SuperballVR
Superball VR is a new and unique take on the classic games of tennis and
volleyball. It combines the two in a virtual reality environment accessible by
anyone with a PCVR system.

## Getting Started
This project uses Unity Hub to develop in the Unity3D environment.

To start developing for the first time, follow these steps:

### Register License
1. Log in to Unity or create an account at https://id.unity.com/. Feel free to use
any email you want on this step.

2. Apply for a Unity license. Students get the Pro license for free at
https://unity.com/products/unity-student. Input the requested details, making sure
to use your UF email here.

3. You should get two emails shortly after. One is a welcome email and the other has
your license key. Keep that key handy.

### Download and Install
4. Download Unity Hub at https://unity.com/download. Unity Hub allows you to manage
your projects and Unity installations in one place.

5. Install the Unity Hub. Once finished, run it.

6. Sign in to your Unity account and add your license with the license key. This
should take you to the Projects page.

7. Go to the `Installs` tab, and select `Install Editor`. Select `2021.3.11f1` (the
latest official release). At minimum, select the `Windows Build Support` module
since that's our target platform.

### Import and Open Project
8. Now that Unity is installed, we can import our project. In any folder, open
a shell and type the following command to pull the project from GitHub:
```
git clone https://github.com/clt313/SuperballVR.git
```

9. Go back to Unity Hub. Under the `Projects` tab, click the `Open` dropdown and
select `Add project from disk`. Find the SuperballVR folder you created and select
it. The SuperballVR project should be visible from Unity Hub.

10. Open the `SuperballVR` project. This can take some time, especially if opening
for the first time due to installing packages. This should take around 5 minutes.

11. You're good to go! Use your favorite IDE to code and use Unity to connect
everything together.

If these directions are inaccurate at any point, feel free to modify them.
